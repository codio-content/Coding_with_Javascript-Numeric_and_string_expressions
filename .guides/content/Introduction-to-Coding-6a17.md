We are now ready to introduce you to writing real code.

You can choose between 3 programming languages : JavaScript, Python or Java.

We would recommend you learn JavaScript as this opens up the world of web development. You can also do 'server side' development for things like writing to files and database handling.

For those with more time available, you could learn a second or third language. If you decide to do this then the best approach is to work through this module using one language first and go through it again using the other language. You will find that the second pass will be much quicker than the first.
