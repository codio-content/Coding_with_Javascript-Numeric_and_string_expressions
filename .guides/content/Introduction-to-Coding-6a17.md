We are now ready to introduce you to writing real code.

You can choose between 2 programming languages : Javascript and Python.

You can select which language you want to work with from the Settings menu in the top toolbar. When you change this, the teaching content will be adjusted automatically. 

We would recommend you learn Javascript as this opens up the world of web development. You can also do 'server side' development for things like writing to files and database handling.

For those with more time available, you could also learn both. If you take this approach then the best approach is to work through this module using one language first and go thorugh it again using the other language. You will find that the second pass will be much quicker than the first.
