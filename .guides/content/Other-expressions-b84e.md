You may have been told that you need to put semi colons at the end of each line in Javascript. *This is not true.

You *can* put semi-colons at the end of each line but you certainly don't have to. There are only 2 special cases where this is needed and youwon't encounter these cases until you are quite advanced.

So - our advice is to not use any semi colons at all. At Codio, we don't use them at all for our development.
