The way you handle inputs and outputs is very similar to Flode. We also offer a way of outputting debug information.

{Run the code on the left}(node run-user.js 1-intro/io-debug.js)

## Inputs
In your code, you can create your own input variables. `input0` is the first, `input1` the second and so on.

You can create your own test data this way. When the challenge is run, these values will be substituted by whatever data the challenge chooses to supply.

## Outputs
To output data, use the `output()` function as shown on the left. This can contain any valid javascript expressions.

## Debug statements
To write debug information that is shown to you when your program runs, use `console.log()` and put any javascript expression inside the brackets.
