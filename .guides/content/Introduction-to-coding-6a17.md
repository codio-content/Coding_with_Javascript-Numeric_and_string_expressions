You are now ready to start writing real code.

You can choose between 3 programming languages : JavaScript, Python or Java.

You can select which language you want to work with from the Settings menu in the top toolbar. When you change this, the teaching content will be adjusted automatically.

We would recommend you learn JavaScript as this opens up the world of web development. You can also do 'server side' development with JavaScript, this is used for things like writing to files and database handling.

If you have more time, you could learn a second or third language. If you decide to do this the best approach is to work through the course using the JavaScript language first. Once you have completed the course using JavaScript, you will find it much easier to work through the course again using Python or Java. You should also be able to work much more quickly the second and third time around!
