A very important skill you need to develop as a good coder is how to detect and fix syntax errors (also known as bugs) in your code.

The following challenges all have errors in the code. You will need to hunt the bugs down and squash them!

Look back at the earlier page '1.3 Errors' if you need to refresh your memory on how to deal with errors.

## Important

During these challenges, you might make mistakes and want the code back as it was originally. If this is the case, you can restore the contents of the two fix challenges to their original state by selecting the **'Restore current files'** option from the **'Settings'** menu.
