You may have been told that you need to put semicolons `;` at the end of each line in JavaScript code. **This is not true**.

You *can* put semicolons at the end of each line but you certainly don't have to. There are only 2 special cases where this is needed and you won't encounter these cases until you are much more advanced and even then it will be very rare.

So, our advice is to not use any semicolons at all. At Codio, we don't use them at all for our development.
